  # The launchd agents `alas-host install-agent` installs, one per profile.
  # Not on uninstall, which an upgrade runs too: an agent survives upgrades,
  # and stops by itself once the app is gone (it runs while its executable
  # exists). The everyday profile's label is named as is: Homebrew's
  # wildcard matches only agents running at the time.
